# Biometric-Attendance-System
This project introduces an Automatic Biometric Attendance System leveraging Bluetooth technology and biometric authentication for simplified attendance tracking in educational and organizational settings. By replacing traditional methods, the system utilizes the HC-05 Bluetooth module to establish communication with a dedicated mobile app, displaying real-time attendance information, including the date, time, student name, ID, and status (in/out). The implementation proves valuable in enhancing record-keeping by providing accurate and up-to-date entry and exit timestamps, contributing to a more efficient and secure attendance management system.
